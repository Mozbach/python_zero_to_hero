# Web scraping is a general term for techniques involving automating the gathering of data from a website.
# In this section we will learn how to use Python to conduct web scraping tasks, such as downloading images or information off a website.
# In order to web scrape with Python, we need to understand the basic concepts of how a website works.
# When a browser loads a website, the user gets to see what is known as the "front-end" of the website.

#  Min things we need to understand
    #  Rules of Web Scraping
    # Limitations of Web Scraping
    # Basic HTML and CSS

# Rules of WebScraping
    # Always try to get permission before scraping
    # If you make too many scraping attempts or requests, your IP address could get blocked.
    # Some sites automatically block scraping software

# Limitations of Web Scraping
    # In general every website is unique, which means every web scraping scriopt is unique.
    # A slight change or update to a website may completely break your webscraping script

# To web scrape with python, we can use the BeautifulSoup and request libraries.
# These are external libraries outside of Python, so you need to install them with either conde or pip at your command line.

# Directly at your comman line, use:
    # pip install requests
    # pip install lxml
    # pip install bs4
# Or for Anaconda distributions, use conda install instead of pip install.
