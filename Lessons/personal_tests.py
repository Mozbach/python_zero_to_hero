# Complete the blackjack one which I had going on....Just need to finish up here.
# I know what still needs to happen there is the ace-check. Im onto something, I just need to execute it correcly.
# I aslo want to give the player the option after each mach to have another game or not - his chip count must naturally adjust accordingly.
# Finally, when you end the game, ask if you want to save your score, then if you do  - the name and score can be saved in a text file "High Scores" or something like that
# Then, maybe during the game, one should be able to type "Scores" to call and check the scores... But that one I really don't see as mych of a priority.
