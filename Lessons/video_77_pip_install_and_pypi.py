# PyPy is a repository for open-source third-party Python packages.
# So far we have only used built-in libraries that come standard with python
# Many other libraries are available that people have open-sourced and shared on PyPi
# We can use pip install at the command line to install these packages

# By ijstalling Python from Python.org or through Anaconda, you also installed pip
# pip isa  simple way to download packages at your command line directly from the PyPi repository

# There are packages already created for any use case you can think of.
# A quick google search will usuially help you discover a link to the PyPi page for the package, or for the package documentation.

# Let's download and install external packages
# - Windows Users: Command Prompt
# pip install colorama
# from colorama import init
# init()
# from colorama import fore
# print(Fore.RED + "Some Red TExT!") -> This then changes all the interface text to red... I believe this will only work in the cmd, though.

# Here we install another pip called openpyxl
# pip install openpyxl
# import openpyxl
# > Wham ... ready to use... Just google for documentation to figure out the use of it.
