# Pylint Overview
# Unit Testing
# As you begin to expand to larger multi-file projects, it becomes important to have tests in place.
# This way as you make changes ot update your code, you can run your test files to make sure previous code still runs as expected.

# There are several testing tools, we will focus on two...
# - Pylint: This is a library that looks at your code and reports back possible issues.
# - unittest: This built-in library will allow you to test your own programs and check that you are getting desired outputs

# Let's begin by checking out pylint to check code for possible errors and styling.
# Python as a set of a style convention rules, known as "PEP 8".

# Afterwards we will test code with the built-in unittest library

# I will create the files in a folder called "Pylint Experiments", then work out of that folder.
