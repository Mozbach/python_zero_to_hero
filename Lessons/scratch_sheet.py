# TUPPLES! from W3Schools
# Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable - interesting
# Tuples is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the otehr 3 are List, Set and Dictionary
# A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable (immutable)
# Tupples are written with round brackets
my_tupple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "berry", "guava")
print(my_tupple[3])

# tuples are ordered, immutable and allow duplicate values
#  Tuple items are indexed - similar to lists

# Check length of a tuple
print(len(my_tupple))

# Create a tuple with one item by adding a comma after the item, otherwise Python won't recognize it as a tuple
single_item_tuple = ("peas",)

# Tuples can have any data type and can also contain different data types

# Negative indexing is also valid

# You can specify the range of idexes by specifying where to start and wehre to end the range
# When specifying a range, the return value will be an ew tuple with the specified items

# So a list containing everything from THAT point to the end of the tuple will be created

# FILE HANDLING
# The key function for worling with files in Python is the open() function
# The open() function takes two parameters, filename and ModuleNotFoundError
# There are 4 different methods (modes) for opening a file:
# - r: Default value. Opens a file for reading, error id the file does not exist
# - a: Append. Opens a file for appending, creates the file it does not exist
# - w: Write. Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist
# - x: Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists

# In addition, you can specify if the file should be handled as binary or text mode
# - t: Text. The default value. Text Mode
# - b: Binary. Binary mode (e.g. images)

# Syntax
# To open a file for reading it is enough to specify the name of the file
# f = open("myfile.txt")
# The code above is the same as 
# f = open("demofile.txt", 'rt')

# Open a file on the server
