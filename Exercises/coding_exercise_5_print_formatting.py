Write an expression using any of the string formatting methods we have learned, except f-strings, to return the phrase 'Python rules!'
Your solution should be entered in one line.
No Variable names, only the strings themselves
Reason for no f-strings is because the machine used in the course only hase python3.5.2, and f-strings need Python3.6 or higher
