# Question 1: Tuples have a lot of methods associated with them 
# a: True
# b: False <-- this one, kind of a trick question, because what is "alot", really?

# Question 2: Tuples are immutable
# a: True <-- this one, you can't change specific tuple values like tuple1[2] = "r" 
# b: False

# Question 3: Which of the following is a tuple?
# a: [1, 2 ,3] 
# b: (1, 2, [1, 2]) <-- this one
# c: (1, 2, 3]
