# So here, we won't really tell you what you need to do.
# It is time to test your new skills, this puzzle project will combine multiple skill sets, including unzipping files with Python using os module to automatically search through lots of files.

# My goal is to figure it all out on my own.
# There is a .zip file called 'unzip_me_for_instructions', unzip it, open the .txt file with Python, read the instructions and see if you can figure out what you need to do.

Instructions was:
Good work on unzipping the file!
You should now see 5 folders, each with a lot of random .txt files.
Within one of these text files is a telephone number formated ###-###-####
Use the Python os module and regular expressions to iterate through each file, open it, and search for a telephone number.
GoodÂ luck!
"""
# Here we go...
# What is my plan here... try to loop through each folder and it's contents. This is really a next level one because it was not demonstrated in the course.
# Open the i file, check it for the pattern, if the pattern was not found, close it and move onto the next.
# Check out:
    # os.listdir()
    # os.walk()
# I think walk might be the answer...
# The regexpression to look for the phone number: 
# phone_number_pattern = re.finditer(r"\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}", instructions) # See here, instructions in the loop will be the opened file.
# Make an object out of the result using finditer
# The below works to traverse the folders, I am just uncommenting it to avoid the chaos in the terminal
