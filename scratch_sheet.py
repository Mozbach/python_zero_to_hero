# TUPPLES! from W3Schools
# Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable - interesting
# Tuples is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the otehr 3 are List, Set and Dictionary
# A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable (immutable)
# Tupples are written with round brackets
my_tupple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "berry", "guava")
print(my_tupple[3])

# tuples are ordered, immutable and allow duplicate values
#  Tuple items are indexed - similar to lists

# Check length of a tuple
print(len(my_tupple))

# Create a tuple with one item by adding a comma after the item, otherwise Python won't recognize it as a tuple
single_item_tuple = ("peas",)
print(single_item_tuple[0])

# Tuples can have any data type and can also contain different data types
different_type_tuple = (
    "string",
    True,
    [0, 2, 4, 5],
    {
        "tupDictItem1": 1,
        "tupDictItem2": [2],
        "tupDictItem3": "three"
    }
)

# The tuple constructor:::
declaredTuple = tuple((1, 2, "berry", "peas", [1, 2, 3]))
print(declaredTuple)

# Access tuples the same as you would a list
print(different_type_tuple[3]["tupDictItem2"][0])

# Negative indexing is also valid
print(different_type_tuple[-2][3])

# You can specify the range of idexes by specifying where to start and wehre to end the range
# When specifying a range, the return value will be an ew tuple with the specified items
fruitTuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango")
smallFruitTuple = fruitTuple[2:6]
print(smallFruitTuple)

# indexing rules are similar to slicing rules


# check if an item exists within a tuple
def checkTuple(tupleName, itemName) :

        return f"Yes, {itemName} is in this tuple"
    else :
        return f"No, {itemName} is not in this tuple"
    
print(checkTuple(fruitTuple, "watermelon"))

# Update Tuples

# Tuples are immutable, so they can't be changed, but there are some workarounds
# You can change a tuple into a list, change the list, then change it back into a tuple

# Tuple Items can't be removed, but the list trick with a pop(2), can work
listedTuple.pop(2)
initialTuple = tuple(listedTuple)
print(initialTuple)

# Delete a tuple completely
del thirdTuple
# print(thirdTuple) # 'thirdTuple' is not defined error

# Unpack Tuples
# When we create a tuple, we normally assign values to it, this is called "packing" a tuple
# We can also extract the values vack into variables, this is called "unpacking"
packedTuple = ("avos", "bananas", "lemons", "trees", "witches", "squeez", "weez", "breez")
# (soft, mush, sour, stern) = packedTuple
# print(soft, mush, sour, stern)

# If the number of variables is less than the number of values, you can add an asterisk * to the variable name and the values will be assigned to the variable as a list
# So a list containing everything from THAT point to the end of the tuple will be created
(bigPip, seed, *lemonTree) = packedTuple
print(lemonTree)

# If the asterisk is added to another variable name than the last, Python will assign values to the variable until the number of values left matches the number of variables left - what??? -> To me it looks like it just takes the last one and makes it "notFruit", things before that will fall in the "smallLeaves" list
(greenLeaves, bigLeaves, *smallLeaves, notFruit) = packedTuple
print(smallLeaves)
# Yea, still does not really make sense.... But ok.

# Looping tuples using a for loop
for item in packedTuple :

# Loop throug the index numbers
# Use range() and len() functions to create a suitable iterable
for item in range(len(packedTuple)) :

# Using a While Loop
# Use the len function to determine the length of the tuple, then start at 0 and loop your way through the tuple times by referring to their indexes.
i = 0
while i < len(packedTuple) :
    print(f"Number {i} From While: {packedTuple[i]}")

# Join Tuples
# To join 2 tuples, you can use the + operator.
tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
tuple2 = (4, 5, 6)
tuple3 = tuple1 + tuple2
print(tuple3)

# Multiply Tuples
# If you want to multiple the content of a tuple a given number of times, use the * operator:
multiTuple = ("shani", "lenÃ¨", "daniella")
multipliedTuple = multiTuple * 4
print(multipliedTuple)

# Tuple methods
# count(): returns the number of times a specific value occurs in a tuple
print(multipliedTuple.count("shani"))
# and index()
# Searchjes the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found
print(packedTuple.index("bananas"))



# SETS
# Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variabe
# Set is one of 4 built-in data types in python used to stroe collections of data, the other 3 are: List, Tuple and Dictionary
# A Set is a collection which is unordered, immutable and unindexed
# Note that set items are immutable, but you can still add or remove new items
# sets are written with curly brackets
thisset = {"setItem1", "setItem2", "setItem3","setItem4", "setItem5", "setItem6"}
print(thisset)

# Set items are unordered and immutable, they will not allow duplicate values

# unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order, so you probably can't index them like a list: thisset[2]

# In sets, "True" and 1 are treated as duplicates, to sets they mean the same thing... same with "False" and 0? -> Yes.
for i in thisset :

# FILE HANDLING
# The key function for worling with files in Python is the open() function
# The open() function takes two parameters, filename and ModuleNotFoundError
# There are 4 different methods (modes) for opening a file:
# - r: Default value. Opens a file for reading, error id the file does not exist
# - a: Append. Opens a file for appending, creates the file it does not exist
# - w: Write. Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist
# - x: Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists

# In addition, you can specify if the file should be handled as binary or text mode
# - t: Text. The default value. Text Mode
# - b: Binary. Binary mode (e.g. images)

# Syntax
# To open a file for reading it is enough to specify the name of the file
# f = open("myfile.txt")
# The code above is the same as 
# f = open("demofile.txt", 'rt')

# Open a file on the server
f = open("myfile.txt", "r")
read_f = f.read()
print(print(f"read_f: {read_f}"))
f.seek(0)

o = open("C:\\Users\\crstn\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Myprojects\\ZeroToHeroPython\\\holdsTextFiles\\textFile.txt")
read_o = o.read(6)
print(f"read_o: {read_o}")

# Reads only part of the file:
# By default, the read() method returns the whole text, but you can also specify how many characters you want to return
# Return the first 5 characters in the text file
print(o.read(5)) # not getting anything to actually return... it returns a blank line

# you can return one line by using readline()
print("below is readline: ")
print(f.readline())
f.readlines()
f.seek(0)
